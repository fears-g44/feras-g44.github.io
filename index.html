      <p class="inline"><span class="sameLine">I</span>embarked on my journey at the age of 7 when I took my first steps into education at Al-Shuaida Elementary School. From the very beginning, I demonstrated exceptional dedication and achieved remarkable success, earning a perfect score in all subjects—an early triumph that set the stage for my future endeavors. As I progressed to middle school, attending Al-Thoria Middle School, I continued to shine academically, consistently attaining an impressive 95% in nearly every subject. With each milestone, my passion for learning grew stronger, fueling my desire to excel. Transitioning to high school was another opportunity for me to showcase my abilities, and I seized it with enthusiasm, securing a remarkable 98%—ranking 6th among my peers.<span class="sameLine">Now</span>, as a cybersecurity student at Jeddah University, I am once again demonstrating my commitment and proficiency, maintaining a stellar 4.92 GPA.
